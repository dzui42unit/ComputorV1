# ComputorV1

About

The goal of this project is to bring us back to the manipulation of elementary mathematical tools, which can be useful in many other subjects of 42.

Usage
python3 computor.py [-h] [-v] [-s] equation

Example
> python3 computor.py -v -s "x^2 + 5x - 10 = 10x + 26"

x ^ 2 + 5 x - 10 = 10 x + 26

Reduced form: 1.0x² + -5.0x + -36.0 = 0

Polynomial degree: 2

Δ = 169.0

Discriminant is strictly positive, the two solutions are:

9.00

-4.00
